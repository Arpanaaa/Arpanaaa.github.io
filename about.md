Have you ever considered the discomfort of suddenly having to pay for something you once received effortlessly?

Imagine having to purchase sunlight, a resource freely given by the sun. It seems inconceivable to pay for such a basic necessity.

Reflecting on a more personal example than the earlier hypothetical one, I recall accompanying my mother for grocery shopping in my youth. We would buy vegetables like cauliflower, brinjal, lady fingers, onions, and tomatoes. As a delightful tradition, the shopkeeper would always add green chilies and fresh coriander to our bags at no cost. Regardless of their monetary value, the chilies and coriander brought us joy. 

We still visit the same shop to date, but the landscape has shifted. We no longer receive the green chilies and coriander without charge. We now pay for these once-complimentary items. The transition from receiving them freely to having to purchase them introduces an emotional shift - the **"Pain of Paying."**

This phenomenon taps into our inherent **"loss aversion"** tendency where we as humans, feel losses more acutely than gains. The weight of the loss is much greater than the gain. Previously, the absence of cost for these chilies and coriander was simply the norm, not a gain to be celebrated. Yet now, their purchase serves as a reminder of what once was and what is now lost.

This shift also explains the concept of **"coupling"**. Coupling describes the degree of how closely consumption is tied to the act of payment. Each time we use these ingredients, we are reminded of their cost, further amplifying our sense of loss. It reminds us of how we used to get these chilies and coriander for free a few years back and how we pay for it now. 

In this reflection, I am also reminded of broader economic shifts, particularly the impact of **inflation** on our daily lives. It also strikes me how we often undervalue what we receive freely until it is no longer available at no cost. It is a testament to our evolving perspectives as we mature over time.
