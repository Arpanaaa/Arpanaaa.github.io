Anderson also laid out (and later expanded) core practices for Kanban:

1. Visualize the flow of work: This is where the Kanban board is used in practice; it works from the premise that a visible workflow is more manageable and more easily tracked among users.
   
**2. Limit work in progress (WIP):** By limiting the number of tasks a team or individual can handle at once, Kanban seeks to balance workloads and prevent burnout.
   
3. Manage flow: Kanban enables tasks to move through each stage in the workflow with speed and efficiency.
   
..* Make policies explicit: Kanban empowers teams with transparency; it helps individuals and teams understand how, why, and when work is done.
