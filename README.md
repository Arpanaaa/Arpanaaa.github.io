*From auto manufacturing in the 1950s to the modern digital workplace, Kanban’s evolution holds valuable lessons for today’s distributed project teams.*

Work is constantly changing. Projects multiply across the business and become programs. Programs get grouped into portfolios, and [management practices](https://www.toptal.com/project-managers/scaled-agile-framework/safe-best-practices) become increasingly complex as organizations grow and begin to operate at scale. Even something as simple as an office presence is no longer a given.

[Project managers](https://www.toptal.com/project-managers/freelance) are routinely tasked with handling uncertainty, to the point that adaptability is a core competency for the profession. Throughout all of this complexity, Kanban has remained a keystone of the management world for more than 60 years, enabling project professionals to maintain a clear, high-level view of processes.

It’s easy to see why Kanban has become an essential project management tool. As a lightweight and adaptable workflow method, it offers fit-for-purpose solutions that I’ve applied on projects across diverse industries, ranging from finance to energy to consumer markets. Kanban is capable of handling workflows on its own, but is particularly suited to being hybridized with other frameworks, scaling to an enterprise level, or even serving as the bridge to take organizations from Waterfall to Agile processes.

The 2022 State of Agile Report shows an explosive growth in the use of Kanban—up from 7% of [respondents](https://arpanaaa.github.io/blogs) in 2020 to 56% in 2022. Considering the global shift to remote work that happened in 2020, part of that increase is no doubt due to Kanban use by remote teams.

That said, even with many businesses going hybrid or returning to the office, Kanban is still increasing in popularity. According to the most recent State of Kanban Report, 41% of organizations are applying Kanban across more than 10 teams, with 86% of respondents planning to expand their Kanban initiatives in 2023. Understanding the history of the Kanban system will help you gain a deeper understanding [about](https://arpanaaa.github.io/about) it’s so popular, and how to best leverage it for your projects.
