Kanban History: From 1950s Factory Floor to Today’s Remote Teams

From auto manufacturing in the 1950s to the modern digital workplace, Kanban’s evolution holds valuable lessons for today’s distributed project teams.

Work is constantly changing. Projects multiply across the business and become programs. Programs get grouped into portfolios, and management practices become increasingly complex as organizations grow and begin to operate at scale. Even something as simple as an office presence is no longer a given.

Project managers are routinely tasked with handling uncertainty, to the point that adaptability is a core competency for the profession. Throughout all of this complexity, Kanban has remained a keystone of the management world for more than 60 years, enabling project professionals to maintain a clear, high-level view of processes.
