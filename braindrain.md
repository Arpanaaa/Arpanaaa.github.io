'Tring' 'Tring' my phone rings. I go and receive it. It is a call from my cousin Rohit, who just completed his Undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering and is working for a firm. He is delighted to give me the news that he is going to the United States for his Graduate degree and that he has also received a brilliant job opportunity there. I am elated when I hear the news. I congratulate him and put the phone down.

I am suddenly hit by a series of thoughts in my head. Is it necessary to migrate to the United States for a job and higher studies? Is the United States a solution for a better future? What if I do not want to migrate and go to the United States? If I live in Nepal, will I not have a reasonable income and a good standard of living? Is migration necessary? Why are people migrating? Does Nepal not have the necessities for a bright future for an individual? Why is brain drain so common? Is the exodus of highly skilled and qualified people real?
Brain drain refers to the migrations of persons (born, educated, and trained) to developed countries. It is the migration of human resources with skills. It poses a severe danger to the nation's efforts to develop its human capital. High-caliber individuals like managers, engineers, doctors, educators, scientists, administrators, etc. make the decision to migrate and emigrate. The migration occurs in search of a better salary, higher standard of living, quality of life, and stable political conditions. 

Brain drain can be distinguished into three types. The first is the brain drain between developed nations. People migrate from one developed nation to another developed nation. The brain drain from a developing nation to a developed nation is the second. This is the most prevailing type. The third is the brain drain between developing countries. Individuals migrate from one developing nation to another. 

In developing nations like Nepal, brain drain can be seen as a widespread phenomenon. A lot of the youth of Nepal are migrating and emigrating. The main reason why Nepali youth are moving abroad is the lack of employment opportunities. The wage difference between the same jobs in Nepal and abroad is enormous. A person with a certain level of qualification working abroad and a person with the same qualifications working here, in Nepal face wide wage gaps. Hence, it is more economical for Nepali youth to work abroad rather than in Nepal. He/ She will earn more abroad than in Nepal. Therefore, the youth is settling abroad for better employment opportunities, a standard of living, personal growth, and accommodation. 

Thus, the lack of employment opportunities and unemployment has resulted in migration and emigration of people all over the country. Additionally to the youth, the elderly are also relocating abroad. According to a recent report from the United Nations â€“ World Population Prospects, the net migration rate in 2022 is 4.353 per 1000 people which is a 19.72 % increase as compared to 2021. It is estimated that the rate of migration will increase year after year in the upcoming years. 

Brain drain was a concept that existed in my head until I witnessed it through my own eyes. I recently visited one of the far western districts of Nepal, Baitadi. I stayed at a petite village in Baitadi which was called Nagtadi. I was shocked by the volume of brain drain in the village. It would not be an exaggeration if I say that there were less than 50 men in the whole village which had a population of around 350 people. The village had all women and their children. All of the family's male members had left for jobs in India or elsewhere. The women looked after the home and the animals they reared. The women in the village were involved in subsistence farming while the men went to developed countries for work. 

Furthermore, brain drain harms the source country. It can lead to a reduction of human capital, loss of skills, limited capacity to innovate, loss of nation's investment in education as a highly educated person leaves the country, loss of tax revenues, loss of social capital, loss of critical services in the health and education sectors, reduced economic growth, demographic shifts, and a higher cost of public goods. 

Additionally, brain drain brings a lot of chances of brain waste as well. Brain waste happens when highly skilled individuals move to a region with incomplete information and end up unemployed. Highly qualified individuals do not get complete information regarding the demand and supply of the skill he/she possesses in the country he/she has migrated into and does not get a job there or get a job where the high skills he/she possesses are not required. Many individuals who have migrated or emigrated have been in the trap of brain waste. 
On the other hand, brain drain could also have a positive effect on a country. When highly qualified individuals move abroad, they send a part of their earnings to their home country. The flow of remittance has been increasing drastically. The remittance has reduced poverty and supported families in the home country. The remittance money is invested in housing, education, and healthcare. As per a report from the World Bank, remittance covers 24.3% of the GDP of Nepal as of the year 2020.  

Moreover, brain drain can benefit the host country in many ways. The advantage that a host country receives due to brain drain is termed 'brain gain'. Brain gain is the benefit incurred by a region or a country as a result of the migration or emigration of a highly qualified person. When a highly qualified individual migrates to a country, he/she becomes an asset to the country with his/her skills and innovative capacity. 

Brain drain has also opened new horizons for companies and economies. They are building connections to international sources of cash, information, and goods. They are creating a better social and educative level, better foreign markets know-how, and new business ideas. 

Despite the perks of brain drain in the form of remittance for Nepal, the Nepalese government needs to proactively address the issue of brain drain before it loses all its highly skilled human resources. The government must be aware of the needs and demands of the youth and qualified labor. They must create job opportunities that suit the qualification of individuals. The job positions should also ensure a decent salary. The recruitment process should also be fair. The practice of favoring relatives and family members while recruiting should be stopped.  

Cooperation should be created between the government, universities, and corporations. The youth should be assured that they will receive good employment in their own home country. The government can promote entrepreneurship among the youth. They can provide exemptions and subsidies to promote entrepreneurship and self-employment. They can give exemptions on electricity bills, and tax benefits and also provide subsidized interest rates on loans for those starting their businesses till a certain period. 

The government must attract highly qualified individuals from the rest of the world so that they can benefit from brain gain. To attract highly skilled individuals from abroad, the government first needs to advance in infrastructure and technology. Advancements in infrastructure and technology will as well retain highly qualified and skilled individuals in Nepal. 
Thus, brain drain comes with advantages as well as disadvantages. The government has to retain highly skilled and qualified individuals in their own country rather than depend on remittances. Hence, the government must make continuous attempts to retain people in Nepal and rule out brain drain.
